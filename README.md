# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data Project

The script run_analysis.R is to create a tidy data set from the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
Three data sets one each for subject, activity and features/measurements are merged.

Final data set created summarizes for each subject and activity pair, the mean and standard deviation of the meaurements. 

Descriptive headers is included in the final data set to make it easier for further analysis.

The code is divided into a few parts:-

Downloading and reading the contents of the Data set
Merging the data sets
Selecting only the measurements required for the final data set
Creating headers for the sets
Ordering the tidy data set
Writing the contents of the data set to a file
